Directories names indicate the number of object categories in that data set.

If there are multiple sets of a certain number of categories, they will be
named as (e.g.) "10_1", "10_2", ....

Each training and test set file is of the form:
  "train_N" or "test_N" where N is the number of examples per category.
  The number of classes in the test file does not need to change.
