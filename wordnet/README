Before you start, download libraries by running
  $ ./download_libs
or just run the wget commands in there manually.

Demo from:

This should work with a standard Java compiler.

To compile:
  $ ./compile

To run:
  $ ./run [word1 word2 ... wordN]

Just pipe standard output to a file to save the results.
