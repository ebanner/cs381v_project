\section{Introduction}

Deep neural networks have been very popular in recent years because of their
potential to greatly improve results of pretty much any classification task
that they are applied to.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been especially popular in computer
vision for image classification.
However, despite their empirical success, training a deep learning model
generally requires a massive amount of data, often in the order of millions of
images.

Because of the high computational cost of training and even evaluating new data
on deep neural networks, \cite{hinton2015distilling} have explored a new method
for transfering the learned weights of a complicated deep neural network model
(i.e. a model with a large number of parameters) to a simpler one (with
significantly fewer parameters). They showed that this can reduce the amount of
training data needed by the simpler model while still producing comparable
results, and because it has fewer parameters, it is able to evaluate data
faster.

We attempt to improve classification results and reduce the amount of required
training data for a deep CNN by leveraging the semantic relationships between
object categories embedded in natural language.
Doing so can help significantly reduce the time it takes to train and test a
deep model. Using a simpler model can also help reduce strict hardware
requirements, making it useful on low-end consumer computers or even mobile
devices.
Finally, by reducing the amount of required training data, we hope to show that
our technique can be applied to domains where labeled training examples are
limited, which may have previously prevented deep learning techniques from being
used in those settings.

%There has been a lot of work done in studying the relationship between vision
%and language, showing that it is possible to integrate linguistic information
%to improve visual classification tasks \cite{izadinia2015segment,
%frome2013devise, marszalek2007semantic, grauman2011learning}.
%Studies have shown that there are correlations between visual and semantic
%similarities among visual object categories \cite{deselaers2011visual}.
%Thus, we believe that we can achieve a performance gain and/or reduce the
%amount of required training images, as was done in \cite{hinton2015distilling},
%but using linguistic information instead of relying on the learned weights of a
%stronger deep model.
