\section{Methods}

We plan to extend the method of \cite{zhao2011large} to deep convolutional
neural networks. We hope to show that by using soft labels, our model can
achieve better classification performance. Additionally, we would like to
show that it can learn using smaller amounts of annotated training data.
Finally, we plan to compare different schemes for obtaining the soft labels.
Mainly, we hope to look at different linguistic semantic similarity measures
and compare them with visual similarity measures.
